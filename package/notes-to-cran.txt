Complaints about URL https://users.stat.ufl.edu/~aa/cda/data.html being
"(possibly) invalid" are themselves bogus, as can be checked by
visiting said URL in a web browser

This URL has been changed in this version to point to where the old URL
redirects to as per e-mail from Uwe Ligges

This version replaces \& by & (unescaped) in Rd files

This version also fixes an omitted space between words in DESCRIPTION file
